BIMOS Fishnet is a unity package for BIMOS which add multiplayer!

Networked BIMOS Rig was made with the mindset of inputs and can use either client side/server side movement

Important:
- You will need fishnet 3+ (turn on prediction if fishnet 4 for a better experience)
- You will need some updated scripts I commited from my BIMOS fork

Most Important:
- Have fun :D

BIMOS was my A-level computer science project. I created it to use in VR games that required realistic physical interaction like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/823500/BONEWORKS/">BONEWORKS</a>.
